    <h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>

    <p>Non-seantic tags act as anchors or boxes where the content is placed. Often, these are used for layouts or
        sectioning off the code into boxes. For example, we often see these as the div or span tag for an area of code.
    </p>

    <p>Semantic tags on the other hand are more specific for labeling and describing parts of the code from the header
        to the footer and beyond.</p>

    <p>More specifically, there are a few key benefits of using semantic tags. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cleaner Code - Semantic tags specifically label what each section of the code does, helping not only you as
            the coder understand what is happening but also anyone else who reads the code after you. </li>
        <li>Structured Code - While the labeling is helpful, the tags also help create a hierachy for a section that is
            easy to follow. Such as a header above a paragraph tag.</li>
        <li>Accessibility - Most screen readers rely on the semantic tags to easier navigate a page for those with
            disabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Below is an example of what semantic tags look like when writing code.</p>

    <textarea>
<h1>This is a header.</h1>
<p>This is the writing beneath the header.</p>
<ul>
    <li>We can also use this to make list items.</li>
</ul>
